                    Hello! My name is Gatesana Vongphachanh! I'm a Senior student of Michigan State University, and my major is Computer Science.
                    I am of Laotian descent, however, I have lived in Lansing, Michigan all my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was a kid, I wanted to become a writer. After spending two middle school years writing a tangent of a story, I lost my desire to write.
                    During high school, I didn't know what I wanted to study once I got to university. The Summer I graduated I got invited to Google's CSSI course where 
                    I was taught how to code. I liked it, so I decided to choose Computer Science as my major.
                    I now have experience in Python, C++, C#, C, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    It is my desire to create a silly website for my friends to mess around in and to program games. 
                    I have so many ideas, I'd really like to use games as a medium for story telling 
                    (although in the industry, it's less about the story and more about the gameplay).
                </p>
                <p>
                    My other hobbies include reading, drawing, journaling, baking, and playing video games. I've been trying to cook different dishes these days 
                    so I can feed myself (haha). I'd love to have Sunday tea parties with my friends with the tastiest of desserts and food. 
                    It may seem childish, but the truth is, you need adult money to do the things you once wanted to do as a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ramble and go on tangents at a blink of an eye. So this blog site is nice for me to spill out those random thoughts I have.
                    The topics in my head at a given time vary. I can go from talking about why Asian food is the best, to discussing how a video game robot could realistically exist, to 
                    my current obsession with no interludes. So, I hope you find my scattered thoughts written in my blog amusing.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The "Gate" in my name is so I could be as smart as Bill Gates (according to my mom). But my name roughly translates to "Gate of Destiny" in Lao.</li>

                        I created a terribly coded Python text adventure game based on my "Pick Your Own Adventure" story titled "Monster House".
                        One of my goals is to recreate the game in different mediums: Text-adventure, visual novel, point-and-click, open-world, and rpg.
