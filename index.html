                    There has been many great anime releases this season. The final season of Mob Psycho 100 gets me hyped, 
                    my absolute fave Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun returns with it's 3rd season, 
                    getting my middle school nostalgia kick with Tiger and Bunny Season 2 Part 2, 
                    and beginning yesterday the long awaited Chainsaw Man released!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well... it wasn't long awaited for me, per say. I didn't really read the manga and only found out about the manga because of internet memes, 
                    but from what I heard it's VERY GOOD. My friend is super into it, and we started reading part 2 of the manga together a couple months ago.
                    I do like part 2 of the manga, but I still don't feel compelled to read part 1. Sooooo I'll watch the anime instead!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apparently, the anime is getting 12 different ending songs???? And some of the producers are Vocaloid sensation Kanaria, well renowned eve, the fantastic syudou, 
                    and MAXIMUM THE HORMONE??? IN THE YEAR 2022??? (Ok, so MAXIMUM THE HORMONE's been producing songs, I just haven't listened to them since middle school.) 
                    I'm so hype to listen to their songs. I listened to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMA_isZYsYQ">first opening</a>, and it's by Kenshi Yonezu who did one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aJVr5tTTWk">My Hero Academia openings</a>. 
                    He's got a great voice, I'll have to listen to more of his songs.

                <p><img src="images/IBM_7094.png" alt="The IBM 7094 computer"></p>
                <p>
                    In my MI 349 class there was a lab where I had to create a webpage about HAL 9000 from the movie "A Space Odesey".
                    I'd never seen that movie before, so I was pleasantly surprised when the assignment contained the lyrics for "Daisy Bell"!
                    One of my favorite things is the video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41U78QP8nBk">the first computer programmed to sing</a>. 
                    The IBM 7094 sang the song "Daisy Bell" in an eerie yet sweet tone. (In my opinion) 
                    I really love hearing it sing and thinking about how excited the programmers must've been when their program was a success.
                    I really adore it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found out about the singing computer from an animation by a YouTuber called Doobus Goobus who made the video for his partner (aw!).
                    It's called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqA6J_cbXF4">Little robot sings a little love song!</a>"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The moment I saw the lyrics for my assignment, I rushed to YouTube to find a clip of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8N72t7aScY">HAL 9000 singing the song.</a> 
                    HAL 9000 sings it a lot more slow and deep than IBM 7094, and it makes sense that the programmer would've chosen "Daisy Bell" for HAL to sing.
                    It also has the opposite feel from IBM 7094's singing. Sadness. HAL 9000 is dying.
                    There's a lot of interesting comments on the video I saw which makes me want to watch the movie. I'm not a big sci-fi person, though.
